Welcome to sphinx-extensions's documentation!
=============================================

This is a curated and *opinionated* list of Sphinx_ extensions that I
found useful while working with different Sphinx documentation
projects. All the extension listed here have their own page showing a
working live example and it's minimum configuration to make it work in
your docs.

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/

.. note::

   Sphinx already has a list of `Built-in extensions`_ that are really
   useful. Besides, there is also a list of `Third-party extensions`_
   in that page but unfortunately, it's a bit out of date.

.. _Built-in extensions: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html#builtin-sphinx-extensions
.. _Third-party extensions: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/index.html#third-party-extensions
